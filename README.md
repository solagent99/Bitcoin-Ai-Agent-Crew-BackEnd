## Getting Started

There are two ways to run the backend locally: using Conda (recommended for development) or Docker.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (for running TypeScript scripts)
- Git
- Conda (if using the Conda approach)
- Docker (if using the Docker approach)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd aibtcdev-backend
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

2. Configure environment variables:

- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
- Update the variables as needed

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended for Development)

1. Install Miniconda:

```bash
# On macOS
brew install miniconda

# Initialize conda (required after installation)
conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"
# Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # for zsh
source ~/.bashrc # for bash
```

2. Create and activate a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name aibackend python=3.10
conda activate aibackend
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the TypeScript tools:

```bash
cd agent-tools-ts/
bun install
cd ..
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Option 2: Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t aibtcdev-backend .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env aibtcdev-backend
```

### Verifying the Installation

The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. You can verify it's working by:

1. Checking the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

2. Viewing the API documentation:

```bash
# Open in your browser
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Usage

The backend provides several API endpoints:

- `/` - Health check
- `/bot` - Telegram bot functionality
- `/crew` - Crew management
- `/chat` - Chat functionality

For detailed API documentation, visit the `/docs` endpoint when running the server.

## Development Notes

- The main development branch is `feat/digitalocean`
- Frontend corresponding branch is `feat/cloudflare`
- The system uses OpenAI's API with rate limits depending on your tier
- Bun is used for TypeScript scripts, particularly for wallet operations

## Contributing

1. Branch protection is enabled on `main`
2. Auto-deployment is configured for updates
3. Pull requests require one approval
4. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter rate limit issues with OpenAI:

- Check your current tier limits at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits
- TPM (Tokens Per Minute) limits vary by tier:
  - Tier 1: 200,000 TPM
  - Tier 2: 2,000,000 TPM


## Supabase

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created AFTER INSERT ON auth.users FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
```


### NAME
```sql
handle_new_user
```

```sql
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, username, email)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'user_name', NEW.email);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
```
